#GitHub README for Traffic Hero
##Overview
Traffic Hero was built as a final project for [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/atlanta) Web Development Immersive students. The goal of Traffic Hero is to provide users with traffic conditions on the fly, without having to load up GPS. Traffic Hero allows users to see a live traffic map, with geolocation, and allows users to enter an origin/destination and get information on traffic congestion, travel distance, and time in traffic.
